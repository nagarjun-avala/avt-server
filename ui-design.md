## User Workflows

1. **Adding Inventory**:
   - Admin/Manager navigates to "Add Item" form.
   - Enters the details (item name, price, quantity, barcode) and submits.
2. **Viewing Inventory**:

   - Admin/Manager can view a list of items, along with their current stock, price, and details.

3. **Generating Reports**:
   - Users can filter reports by date range, category, and other criteria to view detailed stock levels, transactions, and turnover rates.

## Usability Considerations

- **Mobile-Friendly**: The design should be responsive, enabling users to access inventory data and reports on any device.
- **Easy Navigation**: A clean, intuitive interface with well-defined roles and permissions for access control.
